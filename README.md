tKeel is a strong and reusable IoT platform that helps you build solutions quickly.

The architecture is based on a **microservices** model, providing a *pluggable architecture* and a **data plane** that is *stable and quick responsive*.

Solving the difficult problems of building an application with high performance, from device to application, modular access, etc.

[‰∏≠Êñá](README_zh.md)

## üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Let's Start

* Quick installation of the tKeel platform via the [CLI](https://github.com/tkeel-io/cli#) tool
* [Example](https://github.com/tkeel-io/tkeel/tree/main/example) will help you quickly understand how to use our tKeel IoT Open Platform.

The [official website documentation]() will have details, from installation to usage details.


## ü™ú Architecture

Perhaps you are interested in the [tKeel IoT platform](), let me give you a brief introduction.

<i data-selectable-paragraph="">Architecture</i>

</div>

- ### **Resource**
Something related to data storage, which can be any database you use.
- ### **Core**
Like the name suggests, this is the data core of the entire platform, providing some **form of data organisation** as well as **processing methods**.
- Provides different forms in which data can be organised such as *time series*, _attribute_, *relationships*, etc., making data into easily understood objects that can be easily constructed and developed.
- Data interaction is resolved by means of **snapshots** and **subscriptions** (Event data).

- ### **Service**
Provides the *pluggable capability* that applications need, plus some *core functionality (message routing, tenant management, rights control)*.
- ### **Interface**
Easy *tools* and friendly *interfaces* to **Application** through encapsulation.
- ### **Application**
Applications of different volumes; can be everything your existing platform has to offer.
- Existing platforms can simply use the data they need by calling the API provided by **Interface**.

## ‚úÖ Reasons to Trust Us

### ü•õ Keep it Simple

The `tKeel` platform summarises the generic problems encountered in IoT development over the years, as well as some tough challenges; finally there is this open platform that can solve the pain points in IoT development.

`tKeel` is good at dealing with data flow and abstraction in distributed systems, shielding the underlying complexity and providing **simpler**, **more developer-oriented** abstractions outwards to help users **quickly build* IoT solutions.

### ‚õìÔ∏è Lightweight, but Powerful

The `tKeel` IoT Open Platform is based on *microservices architecture*, is not vendor-bound and offers an efficient development approach that is **scalable**, **reliable** and **high performance**.

With the power of [Dapr](https://dapr.io), a *simpler* abstraction is provided to the user in the form of [sidecar](https://docs.dapr.io/concepts/dapr-services/sidecar/), interacting via `HTTP` and `gRPC`.

The `tKeel` platform allows your code to ignore the hosted environment, allowing device docked applications/plugins **highly portable** and **not restricted by programming language**, allowing developers to develop to their heart's content using their preferred technology stack.

### üîå Pluginisation

The Plugin implementation is based on the **OpenAPI convention**, making deployment simple and lightweight through a cloud-native approach.

The plugin mechanism makes it easy to reuse plugins that you or others have made public.

We provide an [Official Plugin Repository]() where developers can pick and choose plugins for their own scenarios. Of course, if you can make your plugins publicly available, developers with similar needs would appreciate it.

With [Plugin Guide]() you will find that implementing plugins is a very simple task.

### üìä Focus on Data

The `tKeel` IoT Open Platform defines **data entities** through a data centre ([tKeel-io/Core](https://github.com/tkeel-io/core ) ) and simulates and abstracts real-world objects (things).

You can define **relational mappings** for more, faster and easier data refinement through the platform's powerful capabilities.

With the design of **data entities**, we can adapt this abstract design to *messages*, _measurement points_, *objects* and *relationships*, and the platform provides **multi-level** and **multi-latitude** data services.

Configuring **relational mapping** eliminates the need to remember complex `Message Topics` and `Message Formats` as we provide a high performance data processing solution.

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

We have planned a [roadmap](https://github.com/tkeel-io/tkeel/issues/30)  to do more support for the project.

## üí¨ Shall We Talk

If you have any suggestions or ideas, you are welcome to file an [Issue](https://github.com/tkeel-io/keel/issues ) at any time, we'll look forward to sharing them together to make the world a better place.

**Thank you very much** for your `feedback` and `suggestions`!

[Community Documents](docs/development/README.md) will give you an idea of how you can start contributing to tKeel.

### üôå Contributing

[The Development Guide](docs/development/developing-tkeel.md) explains how to configure your development environment.

We have this [Code of Conduct] that we expect project participants to follow. Please read it in full so that you know what will and will not be tolerated.
